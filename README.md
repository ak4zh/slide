# SLIDE: SvelteKit + Lucia + i18n using inlang + Drizzle + TailwindCSS using Skeleton

- Multi Tenant configured
- [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/) for authentication
- [inlang](https://inlang.com) for language translation
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for database connectivity and type safety
- [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev) for ui elements
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) for icons
- [Zod](https://zod.dev)
- [Superforms](https://superforms.vercel.app) to handle form validation and management.

Highly inspired from [Sveltekit Auth Starter](https://github.com/delay/sveltekit-auth-starter) which uses prisma, I wanted one with drizzle ORM and a [BottomBar](https://github.com/delay/sveltekit-auth-starter/pull/10) as I prefer to use bottom bar in mobile views.
